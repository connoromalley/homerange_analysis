This analysis compares home range size with habitat quality. We found that mountain lions have smaller home ranges and travel less as habitat quality goes up. This suggests that mountain lion density is a function of habitat. 

Home ranges were estimated using auto-corelated kernel density and habitat quality was estimated using a random forest resource selection function.
